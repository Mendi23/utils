# Geometric distribution
The probability distribution of the number $X$ of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success

$$P(X=k) = (1-p)^{(k-1)}p$$
$$E(X) = \frac{1}{p}, \quad var(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2} $$
Conditions:
* The phenomenon being modeled is a sequence of independent trials.
* There are only two possible outcomes for each trial, often designated success or failure.
* The probability of success, $p$, is the same for every trial.


## Coupon collector's problem
**Question:** Given $n$ coupons, how many coupons do you expect you need to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once?
